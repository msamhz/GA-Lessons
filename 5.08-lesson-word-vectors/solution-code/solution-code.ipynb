    "## Contextualized/Dynamic Word Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "What are some shortcomings of `Word2Vec`? It takes into consideration the meaning of words based on context in the corpus, but what about words with different meanings?\n",
    "\n",
    "How many meanings can you think of for the word \"set\"? This word [holds the record](https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/english-word-with-the-most-meanings/) for the most number of meanings in the English language. Even a word like \"apple\" can take on vastly different meanings in today's age. `Word2Vec` assigns one vector for each word.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dynamic Word Embeddings** overcome this shortcoming by assigning an embedding to each word after looking at the sentence of the words. This means that the same words (e.g. \"apple\" in a sentence about fruit and \"Apple\" in a sentence about computers) can be represented by different vectors based on their contexts. One of the first popular models that did this was called **ELMo**. Another popular one is named **BERT**.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/bert.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"200\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "[BERT](https://github.com/google-research/bert) (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) was created by Google in late 2018 and continues to outperform other language representation models. It combined ELMo and several other transformers and is fully bidirectional allowing words to have different vectors based on the context of the word.\n",
    "\n",
    "BERT is an example of a Transformer model. The following is from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model)):\n",
    "\n",
    "> Like recurrent neural networks (RNNs), Transformers are designed to handle sequential data, such as natural language, for tasks such as translation and text summarization. However, unlike RNNs, Transformers do not require that the sequential data be processed in order. For example, if the input data is a natural language sentence, the Transformer does not need to process the beginning of it before the end. Due to this feature, the Transformer allows for much more parallelization than RNNs and therefore reduced training times.  \n",
    "Since their introduction, Transformers have become the model of choice for tackling many problems in NLP, replacing older recurrent neural network models such as the long short-term memory (LSTM).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use Hugging Face's [transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) for this section."
