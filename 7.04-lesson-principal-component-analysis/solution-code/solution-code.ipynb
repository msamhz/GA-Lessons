To generalize this to non-square/non-diagonalizable matrices, we more commonly use the [Singular Value Decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition) (SVD) for PCA.

    "Well, we're transforming our data. Specifically, we are:\n",
    "1. We are going to look at how all of the $X$ variables relate to one another, then summarize these relationships. (This is done with the **covariance matrix**.)\n",
    "2. Then, we will take this summary and look at which combinations of our $X$ variables are most important. (We will decompose our covariance matrix into its **eigenvectors**, which is a linear algebra term that allows us to understand the most important \"directions\" in our data, which are our principal components!)\n",
    "3. We can also see exactly how important each combination is, then rank these combinations. (With each eigenvector, we get an **eigenvalue**. This eigenvalue is a number that tells us how important each \"direction\" or principal component is.)\n",

    "\n",
    "Remember that one of our goals with PCA is to do dimensionality reduction (a.k.a. get rid of features).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can: \n",
    "- measure how important each principal component is using the eigenvalue, \n",
    "- rank the columns of `Z_train` by their eigenvalues,\n",
    "- then drop the columns with small eigenvalues (little importance) but keep the columns with big eigenvalues (very important).\n",
    "    - In `sklearn`, when transformed by PCA, the columns will already be sorted by their eigenvalues from biggest to smallest! The first column will be the most important, the second column will be the next most important, and so on.\n",
