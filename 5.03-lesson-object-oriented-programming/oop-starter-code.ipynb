    "# Programming Paradigms\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many **programming paradigms** (ie, programming patterns/styles). Each paradigm provides a completely different way of thinking about how to design software. Many languages (including Python) are multi-paradigm; they borrow popular aspects of several paradigms. \n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to learn a paradigm is to use a language that _only_ supports the paradigm, a so-called \"pure\" language. (The exact distinction between \"pure\" and not is often debated!)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functional Programming\n",
    "The FP paradigm involves writing programs that consist only of _pure functions_. In FP:\n",
    "- No mutable variables. This has the consequence of outlawing _for_ loops and emphasizing recursion.\n",
    "- No side effects. Functions have no effect on the system aside from returning a value (i.e. no `print`).\n",
    "- Functions _always_ return the same output given the same inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You already have some experience with this style. For example, `map` and `apply` avoid _for_ loops by accepting a function as an argument. \n",
    "\n",
    "| \"Pure\" FP languages | Highly influenced by FP |\n",
    "| -----      | ----- |\n",

    "| Scheme (and Lisp)   | R (popular with statisticians) |\n",
    "| Clojure | Mathematica |\n",
    "| Racket |  |\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of FP:\n",
    "- Allows some complex ideas to be expressed simply (e.g. `map`, `apply`).\n",
    "- Code is automatically scalable/parallelizable! Hence, FP is popular when working with big data.\n",
    "- Code can more easily be proven correct, due to simplicity and reliance on recursion.\n",
    "- Is often easy to prototype new languages in, since data _is_ code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of FP:\n",
    "- Often has a steep learning curve. \n",
    "- Has a strong foundation in theoretical mathematics, so the community can feel mathy to newcomers. (Functional languages are based on the \"lambda calculus\" model of computation instead of the \"Turing machine\" model.)"

    "- **Encapsulation.** Attributes and methods are bound together and protected from misuse.\n",
    "- **Abstraction.** Implementation details are not exposed.\n",
    "- **Inheritance.** In a hierarchical manner, objects can inherit properties and methods from other objects.\n",
    "- **Polymorphism.** Functions (and hence operators) can be \"overloaded\" and change their functionality based on the data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP was developed in an attempt to make code easier to write in large teams. Initial optimism led to a wave of popular OOP implementations, e.g. Java and C++. However, although OOP seems intuitive for some things, many programming ideas are not easily expressed in the OOP paradigm. \n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, OOP programs can easily become extremely complex and verbose if not carefully designed. For example, because data is hidden it is often difficult for one object to get access to necessary data. \n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Other paradigms:\n",
    "- **Procedural programming**: In DSI, we definitely _use_ some aspects of functional programming and OOP. However, the way we design software tends to be _procedural_. A procedural style is where functions (aka \"procedures\") are the highest level of abstraction. This style is good to know, because it is how your CPU works! \"Pure\" procedural languages include C and BASIC. \n",
    "- **Declarative programming**: A declarative style is where you tell the computer _what_ to do, rather than _how_ to do it. Declarative programming works best in so-called \"domain-specific languages,\" since optimizing _how_ to do things is not possible in a general way. An example of a declarative language is SQL, e.g. `SELECT make, model, year, mpg FROM car WHERE mpg > 40;`.\n",

    "### When would we needs this?\n",
    "Luckily for us, between `pandas` and `sklearn`, most of the classes we need have already been built for us. But data scientists don't work in a vacuum! Here are some examples of times where building your own class is the right thing to do:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Whenever you want to bundle your code into a package.\n",
    "It's true that you can define functions that can be `import`ed, but it's not very _Pythonic_. True Pythonistas will build related tools into classes that can be shared amongst coworkers. **If you set this up properly, you can even have them be `pip install`able from either a private or prublic Git repository!** Think about all of the different libraries we've used so far. You know this pattern to be true!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Whenever you want to \"build once, run many times later.\"\n",
    "Imagine a complicated task, such as connecting to a server and executing code on it. These tasks typically have a lot of rote boilerplate code that you'd want to automate. For example, check out this fantasy code you might write for connecting to a SQL server:\n",

    "Most of Python's unit testing capabilities require you to build classes, where each method is an individual suite of tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Unit testing** is a type of automated testing you can do to ensure that minor changes you make to your code don't fundamentally change what your code is doing.\n",
    "\n",
