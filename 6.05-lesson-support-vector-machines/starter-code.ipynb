    "SVMs can be used for regression problems as well! The main ideas are the same - we still specify a cost tolerance `C` and a kernel - but [it's a bit more complicated](https://www.saedsayad.com/support_vector_machine_reg.htm). (For example, visualizing a \"margin\" is easier to do when we're separating two classes than when we're trying to predict some continuous outcome.) For this reason, we won't get into the mathematical details of support vector machines applied to regression, but we can instantiate a model using `svr = sklearn.svm.SVR()` and `.fit()`, `.predict()` like we do with all of our other models! Check out the documentation for [regression SVMs here](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.SVR.html)."
