Question 1: sample of 80 individuals, 99% confidence level, 166.2 - 182
True or false? 

99% probability men lies on in the range? 

Answer: False, it only tells us out of 
conf interval - parameter u want to estimate: mean average height 
means -> repeat 100 times, one of them will not contain the true mean 


Qn2: height 15 men and women
t - test 
p value = 0.031 

True or false 
p(men have different height) is 0.031

Answer: False

What is the null hypo in this case? 
your assertion --> difference of the means test -- of the women and men 

qn3: Could i reject the null hypo at 99% confidence level? 
what about the 99% confidence level? 

can reject at 99% but cannot at 95%.

p-value 0.03 > 0.01 -->> can reject
p-value 0.03 < 0.05 -->> cannot reject
