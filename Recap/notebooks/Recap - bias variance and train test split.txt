Question 1) general function called and where called from 

Assuming given dataframe x and series y 

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.7)

Qn 2) 

cross validation 
- repeat 5 train test split times 
not correct, cause will have overlapping 

Qn 3) 
visuallly 5 fold cross validation 
- take any one row data set 
- how many times this row to fit this row - 4 times 
- how many times used to validate the model  - validates once 

Once. To prevent duplicated effect of the other groups of train/test data. 

Qn4) 

common pract to split in train and test 
- given doing this, why do we cont to do cross validation in the train set 
answer 
- cause even though it is randomly taken out into test and train, we want to nullify the effect that the data sets might have some relationship 

in extreme case of cross validation as they are in the rows of the data set 
- what is it called? 
and why ?
Ans --> Leave one out cross validation (LOOCV)


Bias variance 

1) fit linear regression with only square footage 
- underfit cause it will have high bias and low variance. need more variables 

2) low variance and high bias, not possible to reduce bias for linear regresison? 
not true. 

can transform power 
can add more variables 


3) sum of squared error reduces in three terms, what are they? 

bias - 
variance 
irreducible error - error cause by noise in the data that cannot be removed 

4) Bias-var tradeoff

y = error and x axis ->> model complexity
