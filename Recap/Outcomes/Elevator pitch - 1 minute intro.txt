elevator pitch

Driven by thirst for sheer problem-solving and motivated by growth, my passion to tell a story through data via tool manufacturing issue became more prevalent. Not only did I self-learn Python, I proceeded to further hone these skills on data analysis and deep-learning with General Assembly. I truly believe from a fast-paced environment and being quick on foot places me in an advantage to pick up new knowledge fast and apply my skills practically creatively in real-world scenarios, aligning well with my interest in the data science industry.
