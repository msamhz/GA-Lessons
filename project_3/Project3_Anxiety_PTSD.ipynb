It's too personal for my regular social media but I have to put it into writing in some way.\\n\\nI've been avoiding googling my abusive ex boyfriend for ten years. Just thinking about him made me sick. Two years ago I finally got trauma therapy to deal with what he did to me. Constant humiliation, degradation, sexual abuse and rape. \\n\\nTonight I randomly felt curious about where he would be in life now, so I googled him. Turns out he died two years ago, about the same time as my trauma therapy started. I found this webpage where his friends and family had written how much they missed him. How they'd never forget his smile, the same smile that makes my skin crawl just thinking about it. \\n\\nI've never felt happy about anyone's death before but I actually feel like celebrating. It's not relief because he was already out of my life and I was never scared of him showing up or hurting me again. It's just.. triumph. I still suffer the consequences of what he did to me. I still can't make relationships work and I still flinch when men get close to touching me because of him.

       "1  I just need to share this and my feelings about it somewhere. It's too personal for my regular social media but I have to put it into writing in some way.\\n\\nI've been avoiding googling my abusive ex boyfriend for ten years. Just thinking about him made me sick. Two years ago I finally got trauma therapy to deal with what he did to me. Constant humiliation, degradation, sexual abuse and rape. \\n\\nTonight I randomly felt curious about where he would be in life now, so I googled him. Turns out he died two years ago, about the same time as my trauma therapy started. I found this webpage where his friends and family had written how much they missed him. How they'd never forget his smile, the same smile that makes my skin crawl just thinking about it. \\n\\nI've never felt happy about anyone's death before but I actually feel like celebrating. It's not relief because he was already out of my life and I was never scared of him showing up or hurting me again. It's just.. triumph. I still suffer the consequences of what he did to me. I still can't make relationships work and I still flinch when men get close to touching me because of him. I'm not ashamed to say that I hope he suffered before he died.\\n\\nThere's not much to discuss here I guess, I just didn't know where else to share this honestly.   \n",

Everyday was hell.  Of course I now have complex PTSD.  I'm 64 now and am still traumatized.  My whole life was ruined by the time I was 23.  I never got married, never had kids.  I've been a loner ever since. I still get intrusive memories of horrific child abuse.  I don't know why I'm even posting this.  But I know people here understand.   \n",

       "1  i just need to share this and my feelings about it somewhere its too personal for my regular social media but i have to put it into writing in some way ive been avoiding googling my abusive ex boyfriend for ten years just thinking about him made me sick two years ago i finally got trauma therapy to deal with what he did to me constant humiliation degradation sexual abuse and rape  tonight i randomly felt curious about where he would be in life now so i googled him turns out he died two years ago about the same time as my trauma therapy started i found this webpage where his friends and family had written how much they missed him how theyd never forget his smile the same smile that makes my skin crawl just thinking about it  ive never felt happy about anyones death before but i actually feel like celebrating its not relief because he was already out of my life and i was never scared of him showing up or hurting me again its just triumph i still suffer the consequences of what he did to me i still cant make relationships work and i still flinch when men get close to touching me because of him im not ashamed to say that i hope he suffered before he died theres not much to discuss here i guess i just didnt know where else to share this honestly   \n",
