The whole ordeal took about 20 minutes. I felt so bad. And my crush was so helpful. I apologized to him after the whole thing was over, and he was so kind about it. I know it's not a big deal, but in the moment, I was shaken up. I felt bad for the two guys who had to wait there, my crush for getting dragged into my mess, the manager for having to get off her lunch early. So I was really shaken up.\\n\\nI'm normally a shy person, but I was very much timid after. I wasn't as talkative, and I didn't really want to look at him or my manager in the eye. I would get startled more easily by customers. My crush was being more nice to me that day. He's always very nice, but I could kind of tell in his voice that he was trying to reassure me. When it was time to clean tables, he told me to sanitize and that he'd take care of everything else. He's always helpful when it comes to work, but it was almost like he was trying to take a load off me.</td>\n",

My impediment takes away my ability to say the “r” sound, which makes it difficult for people to understand me whenever I speak. I never really thought of the way I spoke until people around me began asking why I speak the way I do. I’ve been made fun of for the way I talk. I’ve been mocked. And several people, including a child, has tried to correct the way I speak. This has caused me to feel very self conscious whenever I’m talking. I avoid saying certain words that have that heavy “r” sound. And this makes it so difficult for me to introduce myself to new people, and to also give speeches in my classes.\\n\\nWriting this post is very hard for me.

       "1   My crush and I work together at our on campus restaurant. I was at the register, and these two guys walked in. They got some food, and paid with cash. I wasn't paying attention, and I accidentally forgot to close the register. I realized as soon as I did it, and my crush overheard what happened. He was restocking some cans, and he walked over to me and asked what happened. I told him what happened, and he tried to see if he could unlock the machine. You need an ID number to open it, and his didn't work.\\n\\nNo one else was working, so we needed our manager to open it. But our manager was on her lunch, so she needed to clock back in to open it. The whole ordeal took about 20 minutes. I felt so bad. And my crush was so helpful. I apologized to him after the whole thing was over, and he was so kind about it. I know it's not a big deal, but in the moment, I was shaken up. I felt bad for the two guys who had to wait there, my crush for getting dragged into my mess, the manager for having to get off her lunch early. So I was really shaken up.\\n\\nI'm normally a shy person, but I was very much timid after. I wasn't as talkative, and I didn't really want to look at him or my manager in the eye. I would get startled more easily by customers. My crush was being more nice to me that day. He's always very nice, but I could kind of tell in his voice that he was trying to reassure me. When it was time to clean tables, he told me to sanitize and that he'd take care of everything else. He's always helpful when it comes to work, but it was almost like he was trying to take a load off me.   \n",

I've been in night clubs twice over the past couple of months, both after I've had a few drinks with friends. On both occasions I've had to leave early because I get anxious about the number of people around resulting in a panic attack. I never used to be like this before covid and I'm generally ok in crowds sober. Anyone got any tips to cope?   \n",

Everyone my age has already got their lives together while me i still dont have shit. No driving license, not a part of any community, no friend I can count on, nothing. I'm completely alone in my own world. I've been wasting too much time throughout my whole life, concerning too much about my academic yet still dumb and incapable of anything. Me and my stupid anxiety will get me nowhere in life.. I cant even make friend, I got this feeling that nobody wants to be my friend - why would they? I cant even talk to anyone without being anxious, cant tell anyone about myself because i believe nobody cares and i will just waste their time. Theres no future in me. Im shitty and totally worthless.   \n",

I know that almost all of the strains that cause plantars are not ones that infect the genitals but type 66 is one that both diseases share. Doom acrolling or something but im freaking out a bit.

I'm in a good place where i feel receptive to the help meds could bring me, but my family is riddled with mental illness and I've heard anti-anxiety meds could send you into mania if the potential for that exists already. \\n\\nCurious if anyone here has dealt with that. I am terrified of the challenge of bipolar mania (which is what's rampant in the family) and that fear is what will put me off trying meds if anything. \\n\\nJust looking for general advice here, but still very much planning on discussing with my therapist 🤗   \n",

       "97          So I fucking love lifting weights but I haven't since the pandemic started. We moved Into a new house and recently signed  up for a larger gym closer to our new place. \\nI've missed lifting so much. Walking into the new gym is overwhelming. I'm 30 and it's a much younger crowd here. Loud teens and 20 somethings. This gym is also bigger so it has a lot of weight machines I haven't seen before. Also these machines are different colors and different brands than what I was used to. \\n\\nMe and my bf just went in for our first session there. I was so overwhelmed. Besides bench press and free weights. Dead lift etc. I didn't know what to do. I felt so anxious. I like my other gym that I was used to where I walked in with confidence and knew what the fuck I was doing. But being in a much bigger and brighter space sent my anxiety through the roof. I also haven't been in a gym in over 2 years. I feel like I've forgotten what to do. I feel inexperienced and embarrassed and overwhelmed. I don't even remember what proper form is. So I told my bf I wanted to sit in the car. \\n\\nHe was frustrated because he wanted to help me but I felt embarrassed and he was like let's look up a workout routine for you. But that was even more embarrassing us  just standing there and talking and me looking lost and upset. He was confused as to why I was embarrassed and frustrated. He doesn't understand anxiety at all. \\nI am currently sitting in the car while he finishes up. I had to leave.  I felt like crying. \\n\\nI hate my anxiety and I hate that my new gym is so big and full of loud people.   \n",

I went to the doctor, did a couple of exams like CT scan and abdominal ultrasound, and I found nothing, but I feel pain and have other symptoms and it gets me anxious because I have no idea if my head is creating the symptoms. The only exam left to do Is kinda expensive and now I can't afford it, we have free healthcare here but it can take like 4 months to be able to see a doctor, let alone schedule an exam like that. When I did the last exam, the doctor almost guaranteed that I had nothing to worry about, since something would have already appeared in one the exams, but I still don't know what caused the lump and I still have the other symptoms so I'm freaking out. Anyone gone through something similar? Any advice on how to deal the anxiety? Should I just trust the doctor and try to forget about it?   \n",

My impediment takes away my ability to say the “r” sound, which makes it difficult for people to understand me whenever I speak. I never really thought of the way I spoke until people around me began asking why I speak the way I do. I’ve been made fun of for the way I talk. I’ve been mocked. And several people, including a child, has tried to correct the way I speak. This has caused me to feel very self conscious whenever I’m talking. I avoid saying certain words that have that heavy “r” sound. And this makes it so difficult for me to introduce myself to new people, and to also give speeches in my classes.\\n\\nWriting this post is very hard for me. I’m always afraid of judgement whenever I talk about my impediment. It’s such a shame to have. A part of me never wants to speak again.   \n",

Constant humiliation, degradation, sexual abuse and rape. \\n\\nTonight I randomly felt curious about where he would be in life now, so I googled him. Turns out he died two years ago, about the same time as my trauma therapy started. I found this webpage where his friends and family had written how much they missed him. How they'd never forget his smile, the same smile that makes my skin crawl just thinking about it. \\n\\nI've never felt happy about anyone's death before but I actually feel like celebrating. It's not relief because he was already out of my life and I was never scared of him showing up or hurting me again. It's just.. triumph. I still suffer the consequences of what he did to me. I still can't make relationships work and I still flinch when men get close to touching me because of him.

Will be discussing what happened to me while experiencing my younger sisters seizures\\n\\nI (20M) feel as though I might have ptsd, I often have some terrifying dreams and I've developed a proclivity for anxiety which was non-existent for many years. Family members often worry about the psychological impacts of what I saw multiple times as a young teen and in my late teens. \\n\\nMy sister had multiple large seizures which would last not long. Usually the ambulance would arrive and they would stabilise her and everything would be fine. A few times however, the seizure lasted what seemed like hours and paramedics seemed to almost be failing (maybe my perception of this is warped it is hazy in my mind).  Once, there were three ambulance teams at my house all while I stood and watched them try to bring her back. It was quite horrific - I believed she was going to die that time. A bad thing was that mum would leave with my sister to the hospital and then I was alone for hours in my house trying to rationalise everything.\\n\\nTo this day she has recovered quite well, but still has her other medical ailments as she is quite special in her own ways.\\n\\nMy memory however of these events is quite hazy. Recalling them always seems foggy so it feels like the experiences can't be causing lasting damage today? But I definitely know something is going on as seeing ambulances while driving regularly brings me to tears for no apparent reason. \\n\\nObviously I'm not asking for a diagnosis, but anyone with similar experience? I worry that this could progressively get worse. I've had a terrible past six months with my relationship ending and my sister needing a total knee reconstruction (her joints are all pretty messed up for some reason). I feel like witnessing her going through pain and suffering again really crippled me. Currently in therapy but haven't been diagnosed by my psych, any advice would be amazing. Cheers</td>\n",

It's too personal for my regular social media but I have to put it into writing in some way.\\n\\nI've been avoiding googling my abusive ex boyfriend for ten years. Just thinking about him made me sick. Two years ago I finally got trauma therapy to deal with what he did to me. Constant humiliation, degradation, sexual abuse and rape. \\n\\nTonight I randomly felt curious about where he would be in life now, so I googled him. Turns out he died two years ago, about the same time as my trauma therapy started. I found this webpage where his friends and family had written how much they missed him. How they'd never forget his smile, the same smile that makes my skin crawl just thinking about it. \\n\\nI've never felt happy about anyone's death before but I actually feel like celebrating. It's not relief because he was already out of my life and I was never scared of him showing up or hurting me again. It's just.. triumph. I still suffer the consequences of what he did to me. I still can't make relationships work and I still flinch when men get close to touching me because of him. I'm not ashamed to say that I hope he suffered before he died.\\n\\nThere's not much to discuss here I guess, I just didn't know where else to share this honestly.   \n",

Everyday was hell.  Of course I now have complex PTSD.  I'm 64 now and am still traumatized.  My whole life was ruined by the time I was 23.  I never got married, never had kids.  I've been a loner ever since. I still get intrusive memories of horrific child abuse.  I don't know why I'm even posting this.  But I know people here understand.   \n",

Everyone around me keeps saying I'll be ok one day but I don't believe that at all. I'm just gonna stop thinking about all of this because ignoring it has been one of the only things that have worked so far. I know I'll be fine if I just stop thinking.   \n",

Not as many as before the prazosin, but enough to effect my sleep patterns. I'm exhausted and I don't want to sleep in case I have another nightmare. I've been on prazosin for about 6 months and the dosage was increased twice. \\n\\nAnyone else have this issue? I seem to be triggered easier now as well. I can't focus. My anxiety is terrible and I'm having panic attacks once or twice a week. I don't usually do this, but I smoked my SO's weed pen and it actually helped a little. So I'm trying CBD tea for sleep but it hasn't worked much. It's helps me get to sleep but then I still wake up after a while. Any advice?   \n",

Then for absolutely no reason, I have another one last night. It felt like days when I was only asleep for 4-5 hours and it was so realistic, I woke up foggy feeling like I had sleep paralysis. Now my clothes are sweaty and I have a migraine. What a way to start the day. Everytime this happens I want to reach out to them more and more for closure but I know I won't get it. I just want this shit to end. I feel like I'm trapped in 2016. I'm so fucking exhausted. Everytime I feel better I get dragged back down.   \n",
       "99  I will be discussing my experience in this post, I think I've flagged this right I'm not sure I'm new to this sub - would hate to trigger anyone. Will be discussing what happened to me while experiencing my younger sisters seizures\\n\\nI (20M) feel as though I might have ptsd, I often have some terrifying dreams and I've developed a proclivity for anxiety which was non-existent for many years. Family members often worry about the psychological impacts of what I saw multiple times as a young teen and in my late teens. \\n\\nMy sister had multiple large seizures which would last not long. Usually the ambulance would arrive and they would stabilise her and everything would be fine. A few times however, the seizure lasted what seemed like hours and paramedics seemed to almost be failing (maybe my perception of this is warped it is hazy in my mind).  Once, there were three ambulance teams at my house all while I stood and watched them try to bring her back. It was quite horrific - I believed she was going to die that time. A bad thing was that mum would leave with my sister to the hospital and then I was alone for hours in my house trying to rationalise everything.\\n\\nTo this day she has recovered quite well, but still has her other medical ailments as she is quite special in her own ways.\\n\\nMy memory however of these events is quite hazy. Recalling them always seems foggy so it feels like the experiences can't be causing lasting damage today? But I definitely know something is going on as seeing ambulances while driving regularly brings me to tears for no apparent reason. \\n\\nObviously I'm not asking for a diagnosis, but anyone with similar experience? I worry that this could progressively get worse. I've had a terrible past six months with my relationship ending and my sister needing a total knee reconstruction (her joints are all pretty messed up for some reason). I feel like witnessing her going through pain and suffering again really crippled me. Currently in therapy but haven't been diagnosed by my psych, any advice would be amazing. Cheers   \n",
