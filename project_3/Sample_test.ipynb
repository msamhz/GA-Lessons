I wasn't paying attention, and I accidentally forgot to close the register. I realized as soon as I did it, and my crush overheard what happened. He was restocking some cans, and he walked over to me and asked what happened. I told him what happened, and he tried to see if he could unlock the machine. You need an ID number to open it, and his didn't work.\\n\\nNo one else was working, so we needed our manager to open it. But our manager was on her lunch, so she needed to clock back in to open it. The whole ordeal took about 20 minutes. I felt so bad. And my crush was so helpful. I apologized to him after the whole thing was over, and he was so kind about it. I know it's not a big deal, but in the moment, I was shaken up. I felt bad for the two guys who had to wait there, my crush for getting dragged into my mess, the manager for having to get off her lunch early. So I was really shaken up.\\n\\nI'm normally a shy person, but I was very much timid after. I wasn't as talkative, and I didn't really want to look at him or my manager in the eye. I would get startled more easily by customers. My crush was being more nice to me that day. He's always very nice, but I could kind of tell in his voice that he was trying to reassure me. When it was time to clean tables, he told me to sanitize and that he'd take care of everything else. He's always helpful when it comes to work, but it was almost like he was trying to take a load off me.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I think that I may have a crippling fear of doing homework.\\nIt started to become noticeable last year in high school, but because of my accommodations I had a period of tutorial study hall once a week. So, it wasn’t really a problem, since I was working there in a small private class room with someone who could help me if needed. \\nBut now in college it’s gotten a lot worse. I can’t get my homework or papers done because I’m too scared and then the assignments are late but I can’t catch up on them because I’m too scared of having to do and turn in late assignments. (This is especially bad since on of my classes is an online class where 100% of the grade relies on homework and papers.) I’m not really sure how to describe it. \\nThe worst part is that when my parents ask how school is going and if I am keeping up with my classes I can’t even seem to tell them the truth. What am I going to do? Tell them that I’m going to lose all of my scholarships because I’m too scared to do assignments?\\nSo, for some reason my brain seems to react to my homework like it’s a literal predator trying to kill me and I have to avoid it at all costs and I really don’t know how to tell anyone or get help. So… please help?</td>\n",

       "      <td>Ok so like 2 or 3 months ive taken prazepam 10mg daily,half in the morning and one at night and it made me sleepy all the time and 0 anxiety which i liked that,but when i went to the doc he lowered the dosage since i didnt have any anxiety attacks ,i still take prazepam but he is trying to stop them making me take only half at night,which doesnt help at all,im in a stressful situation right now and its been getting really bad i feel like vomiting each day i cant eat i cant sleep.I was just wondering if i can take the dosage higher without telling him since he doesnt want to do anything about it.He told me i should be patient.I know benzodiazepines are not longterm meds but i clearly need them.I have no idea what to do anymore.If i up the dosage all the months i tried to stop will go to waste,but i need them too much to stop them.Any advice please?</td>\n",

       "1      My crush and I work together at our on campus restaurant. I was at the register, and these two guys walked in. They got some food, and paid with cash. I wasn't paying attention, and I accidentally forgot to close the register. I realized as soon as I did it, and my crush overheard what happened. He was restocking some cans, and he walked over to me and asked what happened. I told him what happened, and he tried to see if he could unlock the machine. You need an ID number to open it, and his didn't work.\\n\\nNo one else was working, so we needed our manager to open it. But our manager was on her lunch, so she needed to clock back in to open it. The whole ordeal took about 20 minutes. I felt so bad. And my crush was so helpful. I apologized to him after the whole thing was over, and he was so kind about it. I know it's not a big deal, but in the moment, I was shaken up. I felt bad for the two guys who had to wait there, my crush for getting dragged into my mess, the manager for having to get off her lunch early. So I was really shaken up.\\n\\nI'm normally a shy person, but I was very much timid after. I wasn't as talkative, and I didn't really want to look at him or my manager in the eye. I would get startled more easily by customers. My crush was being more nice to me that day. He's always very nice, but I could kind of tell in his voice that he was trying to reassure me. When it was time to clean tables, he told me to sanitize and that he'd take care of everything else. He's always helpful when it comes to work, but it was almost like he was trying to take a load off me.   \n",

Me and my stupid anxiety will get me nowhere in life.. I cant even make friend, I got this feeling that nobody wants to be my friend - why would they? I cant even talk to anyone without being anxious, cant tell anyone about myself because i believe nobody cares and i will just waste their time. Theres no future in me. Im shitty and totally worthless.   \n",

I know that almost all of the strains that cause plantars are not ones that infect the genitals but type 66 is one that both diseases share. Doom acrolling or something but im freaking out a bit. Reading about the treatments for those warts and how they can fuck up my dick, Reading about the risks if i dont take the treatment, getting more depressed and angry at myself for not treating this issue sooner.   \n",

So, it wasn’t really a problem, since I was working there in a small private class room with someone who could help me if needed. \\nBut now in college it’s gotten a lot worse. I can’t get my homework or papers done because I’m too scared and then the assignments are late but I can’t catch up on them because I’m too scared of having to do and turn in late assignments. (This is especially bad since on of my classes is an online class where 100% of the grade relies on homework and papers.) I’m not really sure how to describe it. \\nThe worst part is that when my parents ask how school is going and if I am keeping up with my classes I can’t even seem to tell them the truth. What am I going to do? Tell them that I’m going to lose all of my scholarships because I’m too scared to do assignments?\\nSo, for some reason my brain seems to react to my homework like it’s a literal predator trying to kill me and I have to avoid it at all costs and I really don’t know how to tell anyone or get help. So… please help?   \n",

It's too personal for my regular social media but I have to put it into writing in some way.\\n\\nI've been avoiding googling my abusive ex boyfriend for ten years. Just thinking about him made me sick. Two years ago I finally got trauma therapy to deal with what he did to me. Constant humiliation, degradation, sexual abuse and rape. \\n\\nTonight I randomly felt curious about where he would be in life now, so I googled him. Turns out he died two years ago, about the same time as my trauma therapy started. I found this webpage where his friends and family had written how much they missed him. How they'd never forget his smile, the same smile that makes my skin crawl just thinking about it. \\n\\nI've never felt happy about anyone's death before but I actually feel like celebrating. It's not relief because he was already out of my life and I was never scared of him showing up or hurting me again. It's just.. triumph. I still suffer the consequences of what he did to me. I still can't make relationships work and I still flinch when men get close to touching me because of him. I'm not ashamed to say that I hope he suffered before he died.\\n\\nThere's not much to discuss here I guess, I just didn't know where else to share this honestly.</td>\n",

It's too personal for my regular social media but I have to put it into writing in some way.\\n\\nI've been avoiding googling my abusive ex boyfriend for ten years. Just thinking about him made me sick. Two years ago I finally got trauma therapy to deal with what he did to me. Constant humiliation, degradation, sexual abuse and rape. \\n\\nTonight I randomly felt curious about where he would be in life now, so I googled him. Turns out he died two years ago, about the same time as my trauma therapy started. I found this webpage where his friends and family had written how much they missed him. How they'd never forget his smile, the same smile that makes my skin crawl just thinking about it. \\n\\nI've never felt happy about anyone's death before but I actually feel like celebrating. It's not relief because he was already out of my life and I was never scared of him showing up or hurting me again. It's just.. triumph. I still suffer the consequences of what he did to me. I still can't make relationships work and I still flinch when men get close to touching me because of him. I'm not ashamed to say that I hope he suffered before he died.\\n\\nThere's not much to discuss here I guess, I just didn't know where else to share this honestly.   \n",

       "1  I just need to share this and my feelings about it somewhere. It's too personal for my regular social media but I have to put it into writing in some way.\\n\\nI've been avoiding googling my abusive ex boyfriend for ten years. Just thinking about him made me sick. Two years ago I finally got trauma therapy to deal with what he did to me. Constant humiliation, degradation, sexual abuse and rape. \\n\\nTonight I randomly felt curious about where he would be in life now, so I googled him. Turns out he died two years ago, about the same time as my trauma therapy started. I found this webpage where his friends and family had written how much they missed him. How they'd never forget his smile, the same smile that makes my skin crawl just thinking about it. \\n\\nI've never felt happy about anyone's death before but I actually feel like celebrating. It's not relief because he was already out of my life and I was never scared of him showing up or hurting me again. It's just.. triumph. I still suffer the consequences of what he did to me. I still can't make relationships work and I still flinch when men get close to touching me because of him. I'm not ashamed to say that I hope he suffered before he died.\\n\\nThere's not much to discuss here I guess, I just didn't know where else to share this honestly.   \n",

Everyday was hell.  Of course I now have complex PTSD.  I'm 64 now and am still traumatized.  My whole life was ruined by the time I was 23.  I never got married, never had kids.  I've been a loner ever since. I still get intrusive memories of horrific child abuse.  I don't know why I'm even posting this.  But I know people here understand.   \n",
