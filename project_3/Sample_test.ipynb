The whole ordeal took about 20 minutes. I felt so bad. And my crush was so helpful. I apologized to him after the whole thing was over, and he was so kind about it. I know it's not a big deal, but in the moment, I was shaken up. I felt bad for the two guys who had to wait there, my crush for getting dragged into my mess, the manager for having to get off her lunch early. So I was really shaken up.\\n\\nI'm normally a shy person, but I was very much timid after. I wasn't as talkative, and I didn't really want to look at him or my manager in the eye. I would get startled more easily by customers. My crush was being more nice to me that day. He's always very nice, but I could kind of tell in his voice that he was trying to reassure me. When it was time to clean tables, he told me to sanitize and that he'd take care of everything else. He's always helpful when it comes to work, but it was almost like he was trying to take a load off me.</td>\n",

My impediment takes away my ability to say the “r” sound, which makes it difficult for people to understand me whenever I speak. I never really thought of the way I spoke until people around me began asking why I speak the way I do. I’ve been made fun of for the way I talk. I’ve been mocked. And several people, including a child, has tried to correct the way I speak. This has caused me to feel very self conscious whenever I’m talking. I avoid saying certain words that have that heavy “r” sound. And this makes it so difficult for me to introduce myself to new people, and to also give speeches in my classes.\\n\\nWriting this post is very hard for me.

       "1   My crush and I work together at our on campus restaurant. I was at the register, and these two guys walked in. They got some food, and paid with cash. I wasn't paying attention, and I accidentally forgot to close the register. I realized as soon as I did it, and my crush overheard what happened. He was restocking some cans, and he walked over to me and asked what happened. I told him what happened, and he tried to see if he could unlock the machine. You need an ID number to open it, and his didn't work.\\n\\nNo one else was working, so we needed our manager to open it. But our manager was on her lunch, so she needed to clock back in to open it. The whole ordeal took about 20 minutes. I felt so bad. And my crush was so helpful. I apologized to him after the whole thing was over, and he was so kind about it. I know it's not a big deal, but in the moment, I was shaken up. I felt bad for the two guys who had to wait there, my crush for getting dragged into my mess, the manager for having to get off her lunch early. So I was really shaken up.\\n\\nI'm normally a shy person, but I was very much timid after. I wasn't as talkative, and I didn't really want to look at him or my manager in the eye. I would get startled more easily by customers. My crush was being more nice to me that day. He's always very nice, but I could kind of tell in his voice that he was trying to reassure me. When it was time to clean tables, he told me to sanitize and that he'd take care of everything else. He's always helpful when it comes to work, but it was almost like he was trying to take a load off me.   \n",

I've been in night clubs twice over the past couple of months, both after I've had a few drinks with friends. On both occasions I've had to leave early because I get anxious about the number of people around resulting in a panic attack. I never used to be like this before covid and I'm generally ok in crowds sober. Anyone got any tips to cope?   \n",

Everyone my age has already got their lives together while me i still dont have shit. No driving license, not a part of any community, no friend I can count on, nothing. I'm completely alone in my own world. I've been wasting too much time throughout my whole life, concerning too much about my academic yet still dumb and incapable of anything. Me and my stupid anxiety will get me nowhere in life.. I cant even make friend, I got this feeling that nobody wants to be my friend - why would they? I cant even talk to anyone without being anxious, cant tell anyone about myself because i believe nobody cares and i will just waste their time. Theres no future in me. Im shitty and totally worthless.   \n",

I know that almost all of the strains that cause plantars are not ones that infect the genitals but type 66 is one that both diseases share. Doom acrolling or something but im freaking out a bit.

I'm in a good place where i feel receptive to the help meds could bring me, but my family is riddled with mental illness and I've heard anti-anxiety meds could send you into mania if the potential for that exists already. \\n\\nCurious if anyone here has dealt with that. I am terrified of the challenge of bipolar mania (which is what's rampant in the family) and that fear is what will put me off trying meds if anything. \\n\\nJust looking for general advice here, but still very much planning on discussing with my therapist 🤗   \n",

       "97          So I fucking love lifting weights but I haven't since the pandemic started. We moved Into a new house and recently signed  up for a larger gym closer to our new place. \\nI've missed lifting so much. Walking into the new gym is overwhelming. I'm 30 and it's a much younger crowd here. Loud teens and 20 somethings. This gym is also bigger so it has a lot of weight machines I haven't seen before. Also these machines are different colors and different brands than what I was used to. \\n\\nMe and my bf just went in for our first session there. I was so overwhelmed. Besides bench press and free weights. Dead lift etc. I didn't know what to do. I felt so anxious. I like my other gym that I was used to where I walked in with confidence and knew what the fuck I was doing. But being in a much bigger and brighter space sent my anxiety through the roof. I also haven't been in a gym in over 2 years. I feel like I've forgotten what to do. I feel inexperienced and embarrassed and overwhelmed. I don't even remember what proper form is. So I told my bf I wanted to sit in the car. \\n\\nHe was frustrated because he wanted to help me but I felt embarrassed and he was like let's look up a workout routine for you. But that was even more embarrassing us  just standing there and talking and me looking lost and upset. He was confused as to why I was embarrassed and frustrated. He doesn't understand anxiety at all. \\nI am currently sitting in the car while he finishes up. I had to leave.  I felt like crying. \\n\\nI hate my anxiety and I hate that my new gym is so big and full of loud people.   \n",

I went to the doctor, did a couple of exams like CT scan and abdominal ultrasound, and I found nothing, but I feel pain and have other symptoms and it gets me anxious because I have no idea if my head is creating the symptoms. The only exam left to do Is kinda expensive and now I can't afford it, we have free healthcare here but it can take like 4 months to be able to see a doctor, let alone schedule an exam like that. When I did the last exam, the doctor almost guaranteed that I had nothing to worry about, since something would have already appeared in one the exams, but I still don't know what caused the lump and I still have the other symptoms so I'm freaking out. Anyone gone through something similar? Any advice on how to deal the anxiety? Should I just trust the doctor and try to forget about it?   \n",

My impediment takes away my ability to say the “r” sound, which makes it difficult for people to understand me whenever I speak. I never really thought of the way I spoke until people around me began asking why I speak the way I do. I’ve been made fun of for the way I talk. I’ve been mocked. And several people, including a child, has tried to correct the way I speak. This has caused me to feel very self conscious whenever I’m talking. I avoid saying certain words that have that heavy “r” sound. And this makes it so difficult for me to introduce myself to new people, and to also give speeches in my classes.\\n\\nWriting this post is very hard for me. I’m always afraid of judgement whenever I talk about my impediment. It’s such a shame to have. A part of me never wants to speak again.   \n",

Just thinking about him made me sick. Two years ago I finally got trauma therapy to deal with what he did to me. Constant humiliation, degradation, sexual abuse and rape. \\n\\nTonight I randomly felt curious about where he would be in life now, so I googled him. Turns out he died two years ago, about the same time as my trauma therapy started. I found this webpage where his friends and family had written how much they missed him. How they'd never forget his smile, the same smile that makes my skin crawl just thinking about it. \\n\\nI've never felt happy about anyone's death before but I actually feel like celebrating. It's not relief because he was already out of my life and I was never scared of him showing up or hurting me again. It's just.. triumph. I still suffer the consequences of what he did to me. I still can't make relationships work and I still flinch when men get close to touching me because of him.

(this is due to her being my ride most of the time, us working in the same town, and many things I see leaving the house are triggers.) I know she cares, because she helps me with not being homeless, not starving, and having mental health care...\\n\\nBut the problem is, often she CAUSES me to have a full blown PTSD episode from what was initially mild anxiety. I don't know if she has mental health issues herself from dealing with my mental illness (I went through a period of severe, prolonged psychosis), because if she does, she won't tell me (and I HAVE ASKED, I ask how she's doing, etc.) and she acts like what she does is no big deal and it doesn't matter because \"that's how her brain deals with it\".\\n\\nOk- so your brain deals with me showing minor signs of anxiety, by acting like an asshole and getting pissed off, essentially saying \"ugh, this again? how dare you have mental illness, it's such an annoyance and inconvenience to me!\" (not tryna trash talk my mom, but for real, that is what she says with her body language, tone, and actions.)\\n\\nThis of course makes me MORE anxious, which makes her angrier, which makes me start having more severe symptoms, like flashbacks and thinking I'm going to get killed and panic attacks. Sometimes it leads to me completely panicking and doing dumb shit or trying to kill myself.\\n\\nI've talked to her about this and she is completely APATHETIC. Which makes me fucking sad. It appears that she cares sometimes, but NOT when I'm going through anything besides depression. If it involves anxiety, paranoia, PTSD, or psychosis, SHE IS A FUCKING PSYCHOPATHIC BITCH. She treats me like SHIT. I do think she has issues of her own due to dealing with my issues, but SHE WON'T FUCKING EVER TELL ME ANYTHING. If I knew WHY she acts like a terrible piece of shit towards me during the moments when I need support, or at the very least, NOT ANGER, then maybe it wouldn't affect me so badly. \\n\\nJust wondering if anyone else has a problem like this. I can't move out, I really want to but I'm unable to drive (revoked license) and we live in the country. I'm completely dependent on my mom for everything financially, and for transportation. \\n\\nI'm trying to get disability, because I can't work a real job (my job rn is community service that I can do any time, can leave any time, they understand my problems and of course I'm giving them free labor so they are chill about it, but real jobs just fire me at the first episode. :/) but I only qualify for the sort that gives you the tiniest amount of income so I'd probably get around $300-400 a month. Which is DEFINITELY not enough!! In my area, I could probably find a very shitty apartment and pay for rent, maybe bills if I got $400. I can probably get food stamps, even a small amount would be enough as I typically only eat one small meal a day. \\n\\nI really don't know how to deal with this situation. I HATE it. She is such a JERK to me and DOES NOT CARE when I confront her about it. She thinks her reaction is PERFECTLY FINE and it doesn't matter that she is often the CAUSE of my severe PTSD symptoms. What was at first just anxiety, builds and builds the more angry she gets and the more hyper alert and paranoid I get because of her ANGER over my anxiety. WTF????\\n\\nSometimes, I think she does it on purpose. Like yesterday- she KNOWS a certain type of building is a HUGE trigger for me... and she was \"randomly\" driving around a town I've never been to, and turns onto a road that OBVIOUSLY is a dead end road to this type of building, fucking slow as shit DRIVES RIGHT UP TO THEM and fucking STOPS NEXT TO THEM, right as a slow driving truck passes us. I wanted to grab my knife, jump out of the car, and run so bad. I was SO FUCKING TERRIFIED. \\n\\nBut I just said \"what are you doing??\" mom: \"\\*\"innocent\" passive aggressive tone\\* \"just driving around\" me: \"well drive somewhere else I can't be here!\" and she left, my heart was racing so fast I would have passed out if not for the adrenaline and fear forcing me to be super alert and notice every little detail like there's no stimuli filter in my brain, and obviously, with SO much fucking stimuli out there I found little details connected to traumatic events and I was off on a mental stampede..... god... I hate my mom sometimes. I really do. And I know she also hates me sometimes. \\n\\nI know she cares about me because she tries to help in other situations sometimes, (though she has also accused me of being manipulative when I \\[\"ugh, this bullshit again?\" I assume are her thoughts\\] told her I seriously felt like killing myself. in almost every mental crisis she just gets annoyed, angry, or accuses me of being manipulative, which IDK where TF that came from cause I've never been a manipulative person)\\n\\nShe lets me live here for free, pays for food and medical bills, therapy, meds, etc... but she also buys expensive cars and motorcycles. So obviously, money isn't worth anything to her because she has a lot of it, and insurance that costs no extra if I'm on it pays for most of my medical/mental health related bills. So it's hard to know if she really cares, because what is actually limited and therefore truly valuable- her time- she gives little of. She would rather me go be alone in my cabin than spend time with me. She'd rather be alone on her fucking phone, or spend time with my sister who is 100% healthy, than come within 10 feet of me. :/ \\n\\nSorry this kind of turned into a rant. I just got dropped by my therapist and obviously can't talk to my mom, she just makes me feel worse, my sister hates me and I don't even know why cause she won't talk to me even though she lives on the property, (free of charge as well, it's not just me that gets free shit from mom, we're both adults, I'm 25 she's 21), my dad just runs away, (not literally, but gets angry and leaves) and my only \"friends\" either 1. refuse to talk about anything \"negative\" or 2. only want to talk about THEIR problems and want me to help but never are willing to let me talk about how I'm doing. \\n\\nIf I wasn't on probation I'd just fucking fill up my backpack, grab my guitar and thumb my way to California and live on the beach. I used to have extremely ambitious goals, but I just have stopped caring, nothing matters anymore, I can't outright say it because I'll probably get banned, but I sure as hell wouldn't mind eating a certain vegetable that would turn me into plant food.</td>\n",

       "      <td>tw: s/a, ptsd \\ntldr: mom has ptsd and symptom cause a strain on family relationships \\n\\ni don't really know where to start, this isn't something i talk about often, just because i honestly never realized how much my moms illnesses do affect me. i wanted to talk about it here bc 1. it's keeping me up and 2. curious if anyone else has a parent w ptsd and has similar experiences \\n\\nas the oldest daughter, it's tough. i'm the only one \"old enough\" to understand so i take on the weight of knowing all these family issues. and have extra responsibilities when she's sick etc. most of my childhood i had no idea my mom has ptsd or trauma- i just knew she had a bad childhood and we didn't talk about her dad. i didn't know his name or what he looked like, or what he did until i was 13-14. even now, i still don't know the level of what he did other than it was sa and that she had to see him for years causing more trauma. she didn't start recovering (not sure what the term is, but she started dealing w it) until around the same time when i was in middle school, but her and my dad never told us. which is understandable, but the issue was that because she was in therapy, she was triggered like all the time. \\n\\ni didn't understand why she was acting the way she did, i'd say something that had even a hint of annoyance and she'd just start yelling at me, and it didn't make sense. stuff like that, she'd get mad at the most random things and as a 7th grader, i took it personally thinking i did something wrong. my dad never really explained to me why she was acting like that either, so i thought it was me. and they'd always be fighting during that time. the way our old house was set up, i'd hear them through the whole house but i never knew what it was about. it started as yelling and always ended in her crying and saying how my dad doesn't mean his apologies or something like that \\n\\nbut now that i'm older, they do tell me but it seems worse. i have to carry this weight of \"secrets\" that my younger siblings don't know and i'm not supposed to talk about or say anything to my friends. and being old enough to understand what happened when i was younger, it makes me sad to remember being so confused all the time. \\n\\ni still have a good relationship with my mom, she's a therapist and now specializes in trauma and helps other people overcome theirs which is great. but i still fee like i have to walk on eggshells with her. i'll think a conversation is going fine and then all of a sudden she doesn't like something i said or my tone was off and she gets weird and i end up avoiding her. it's confusing a lot of the times. \\n\\none example that i can think of was christmas two years ago- the neighbors gave us a loaf cake, and my siblings and i helped ourselves, i later came back and took a small second slice (there was plenty left) then went back to my room. she was taking a nap, and came out to see the cake was almost gone, she made a few comments about it and then said something to me about how we were eating soon and i shouldn't have had more, even though clearly other people had seconds after i did. she went back to her room and i said to my brother \"i don't get why she's so upset\" and she heard me through the door. she then proceeded to yell \"i heard you\" and opens the door, walks out of the house and slams the door shut. i was so confused about the whole thing. then she came in and said i couldn't have any dinner bc of the cake. the whole thing didn't make sense, this is the type of thing where she's gotten overly upset about something minor towards me. i know it's something that triggered her, but i don't know every single thing that triggers her and i can't tell if she's actually mad or triggered. even if i can tell that she's probably just triggered, it's hard not to take it personally. \\n\\nit doesn't happen that often (or that intense) but it's the kind of thing i don't know how to explain to like my friends. i wish i could have support from them, but it's so hard to explain to people who don't have someone w ptsd in their life yk? \\n\\nthe other thing is that she's sick a lot, she has a chronic illness that basically makes her really prone to long term sinus infections. it's something you can't see, so i never can tell if she's in pain or not. we moved south because of it when i was little, for the air quality. again, when i was little she was always sick and i didn't understand. she could never work or take us to the store, and i remember feeling confused, disappointed. \\n\\nnow it's more like, she's sick and everything's on pause. dad takes over dinner and everything, i have to drive my siblings to all the things and take on extra chores. it's confusing because she doesn't tell us that she's sick, that a sinus infection is coming on so i have no idea. and then the next day all of a sudden she's stuck in bed the whole day. \\n\\ni feel like the main thing as being the kid, i can't talk to her about my feelings or problems anymore. because 1. she's a therapist, she spends enough time hearing other's problems to care about mine 2. again, my problems are tiny compared to what she deal w on a daily basis. \\n\\ni guess right now where i am myself with my anxiety, ocd, i wish i had someone to talk to about it, the stuff w my mom too. but my friends have their own issues, and can't be the kind of support i need when it comes to this stuff. and like i don't think they'd understand the thing w my mom, i really don't know how to explain how it affects me, but it does. and whatever i tell my dad he tells my mom. i do see a therapist rn, but the sessions are more focused on my ocd. \\n\\ni guess the point of this was getting it out bc i cant sleep, but also i need some advice from anyone with similar experience?</td>\n",

       "      <td>I was at the dentist office with my son, and a very angry man came in to complain to the management.  A petite woman came out to talk to this tall guy, and he kept shutting her down - cutting her off, interrupting, raising his voice.\\n\\nI got triggered hard.  Started hyperventilating, heart started racing.  I tried the ask them guy to have a seat, because he was elderly and using a walker.  He refused, saying he was too mad to sit.  So then I just came right out and told him “listen, I know you’re mad - it’s palpable and I can feel it all the way over here- but could you do me a favor, and maybe sit down for a second?  You’re triggering my PTSD from working with the Army, and I would really appreciate it if your could bring yoir volume down a bit too please.”\\n\\nAfter that, the office lady came to escort him into an office - and asked if I would like to go into one when he loudly refused too.  She could tell I was shook.  I decided to go Outside instead.  Then I decided to LEAN INTO the panic attack (I was crying and shaking and it was hard to breathe).  I just started a YouTube channel on talking openly about mental\\nHealth issues and how I deal with my conditions as naturally as possible.  So I got my phone out and FILMED my Panic Attack - and how I was able to calm Myself down.  \\n\\nAnd it worked!  I got out my essential oils and worry stone and did deep breathing and practiced gratitude.  My panic attack went away, and I was able to go back into the office and not feel like a complete loser for losing my shit in there.  I even shared my Yoitube info and had a great chat with the office staff about mental health awareness.  It was a really awesome way to end what could have been a really horrible visit!\\n\\nJust wanted to share on here because I’m pretty friggin’ proud of myself right now!</td>\n",

It's too personal for my regular social media but I have to put it into writing in some way.\\n\\nI've been avoiding googling my abusive ex boyfriend for ten years. Just thinking about him made me sick. Two years ago I finally got trauma therapy to deal with what he did to me. Constant humiliation, degradation, sexual abuse and rape. \\n\\nTonight I randomly felt curious about where he would be in life now, so I googled him. Turns out he died two years ago, about the same time as my trauma therapy started. I found this webpage where his friends and family had written how much they missed him. How they'd never forget his smile, the same smile that makes my skin crawl just thinking about it. \\n\\nI've never felt happy about anyone's death before but I actually feel like celebrating. It's not relief because he was already out of my life and I was never scared of him showing up or hurting me again. It's just.. triumph. I still suffer the consequences of what he did to me. I still can't make relationships work and I still flinch when men get close to touching me because of him. I'm not ashamed to say that I hope he suffered before he died.\\n\\nThere's not much to discuss here I guess, I just didn't know where else to share this honestly.   \n",

the law and held against my will for 11 months\\nIt was hell.  Everyday was hell.  Of course I now have complex PTSD.  I'm 64 now and am still traumatized.  My whole life was ruined by the time I was 23.  I never got married, never had kids.  I've been a loner ever since. I still get intrusive memories of horrific child abuse.  I don't know why I'm even posting this.  But I know people here understand.   \n",

Everyone around me keeps saying I'll be ok one day but I don't believe that at all. I'm just gonna stop thinking about all of this because ignoring it has been one of the only things that have worked so far. I know I'll be fine if I just stop thinking.   \n",

       "95  TLDR: the title. also, you can't just get away from this person. you are stuck with them. at least for now.\\n\\nMost of the time I'm with my mom when I have symptoms. (this is due to her being my ride most of the time, us working in the same town, and many things I see leaving the house are triggers.) I know she cares, because she helps me with not being homeless, not starving, and having mental health care...\\n\\nBut the problem is, often she CAUSES me to have a full blown PTSD episode from what was initially mild anxiety. I don't know if she has mental health issues herself from dealing with my mental illness (I went through a period of severe, prolonged psychosis), because if she does, she won't tell me (and I HAVE ASKED, I ask how she's doing, etc.) and she acts like what she does is no big deal and it doesn't matter because \"that's how her brain deals with it\".\\n\\nOk- so your brain deals with me showing minor signs of anxiety, by acting like an asshole and getting pissed off, essentially saying \"ugh, this again? how dare you have mental illness, it's such an annoyance and inconvenience to me!\" (not tryna trash talk my mom, but for real, that is what she says with her body language, tone, and actions.)\\n\\nThis of course makes me MORE anxious, which makes her angrier, which makes me start having more severe symptoms, like flashbacks and thinking I'm going to get killed and panic attacks. Sometimes it leads to me completely panicking and doing dumb shit or trying to kill myself.\\n\\nI've talked to her about this and she is completely APATHETIC. Which makes me fucking sad. It appears that she cares sometimes, but NOT when I'm going through anything besides depression. If it involves anxiety, paranoia, PTSD, or psychosis, SHE IS A FUCKING PSYCHOPATHIC BITCH. She treats me like SHIT. I do think she has issues of her own due to dealing with my issues, but SHE WON'T FUCKING EVER TELL ME ANYTHING. If I knew WHY she acts like a terrible piece of shit towards me during the moments when I need support, or at the very least, NOT ANGER, then maybe it wouldn't affect me so badly. \\n\\nJust wondering if anyone else has a problem like this. I can't move out, I really want to but I'm unable to drive (revoked license) and we live in the country. I'm completely dependent on my mom for everything financially, and for transportation. \\n\\nI'm trying to get disability, because I can't work a real job (my job rn is community service that I can do any time, can leave any time, they understand my problems and of course I'm giving them free labor so they are chill about it, but real jobs just fire me at the first episode. :/) but I only qualify for the sort that gives you the tiniest amount of income so I'd probably get around $300-400 a month. Which is DEFINITELY not enough!! In my area, I could probably find a very shitty apartment and pay for rent, maybe bills if I got $400. I can probably get food stamps, even a small amount would be enough as I typically only eat one small meal a day. \\n\\nI really don't know how to deal with this situation. I HATE it. She is such a JERK to me and DOES NOT CARE when I confront her about it. She thinks her reaction is PERFECTLY FINE and it doesn't matter that she is often the CAUSE of my severe PTSD symptoms. What was at first just anxiety, builds and builds the more angry she gets and the more hyper alert and paranoid I get because of her ANGER over my anxiety. WTF????\\n\\nSometimes, I think she does it on purpose. Like yesterday- she KNOWS a certain type of building is a HUGE trigger for me... and she was \"randomly\" driving around a town I've never been to, and turns onto a road that OBVIOUSLY is a dead end road to this type of building, fucking slow as shit DRIVES RIGHT UP TO THEM and fucking STOPS NEXT TO THEM, right as a slow driving truck passes us. I wanted to grab my knife, jump out of the car, and run so bad. I was SO FUCKING TERRIFIED. \\n\\nBut I just said \"what are you doing??\" mom: \"\\*\"innocent\" passive aggressive tone\\* \"just driving around\" me: \"well drive somewhere else I can't be here!\" and she left, my heart was racing so fast I would have passed out if not for the adrenaline and fear forcing me to be super alert and notice every little detail like there's no stimuli filter in my brain, and obviously, with SO much fucking stimuli out there I found little details connected to traumatic events and I was off on a mental stampede..... god... I hate my mom sometimes. I really do. And I know she also hates me sometimes. \\n\\nI know she cares about me because she tries to help in other situations sometimes, (though she has also accused me of being manipulative when I \\[\"ugh, this bullshit again?\" I assume are her thoughts\\] told her I seriously felt like killing myself. in almost every mental crisis she just gets annoyed, angry, or accuses me of being manipulative, which IDK where TF that came from cause I've never been a manipulative person)\\n\\nShe lets me live here for free, pays for food and medical bills, therapy, meds, etc... but she also buys expensive cars and motorcycles. So obviously, money isn't worth anything to her because she has a lot of it, and insurance that costs no extra if I'm on it pays for most of my medical/mental health related bills. So it's hard to know if she really cares, because what is actually limited and therefore truly valuable- her time- she gives little of. She would rather me go be alone in my cabin than spend time with me. She'd rather be alone on her fucking phone, or spend time with my sister who is 100% healthy, than come within 10 feet of me. :/ \\n\\nSorry this kind of turned into a rant. I just got dropped by my therapist and obviously can't talk to my mom, she just makes me feel worse, my sister hates me and I don't even know why cause she won't talk to me even though she lives on the property, (free of charge as well, it's not just me that gets free shit from mom, we're both adults, I'm 25 she's 21), my dad just runs away, (not literally, but gets angry and leaves) and my only \"friends\" either 1. refuse to talk about anything \"negative\" or 2. only want to talk about THEIR problems and want me to help but never are willing to let me talk about how I'm doing. \\n\\nIf I wasn't on probation I'd just fucking fill up my backpack, grab my guitar and thumb my way to California and live on the beach. I used to have extremely ambitious goals, but I just have stopped caring, nothing matters anymore, I can't outright say it because I'll probably get banned, but I sure as hell wouldn't mind eating a certain vegetable that would turn me into plant food.   \n",

I'm not promoting anything illegal, I'm talking about legal psychoactive agent assisted therapies. \\n\\nI'm currently in the process of getting into a ketamine clinic for depression, and every ketamine clinic's website says it also treats PTSD. I've been doing a lot of reading (studies and scientific articles mostly) about ketamine and MDMA (I have no legal access to MDMA assisted therapy in my area, unfortunately) and it sounds really promising. \\n\\nApparently only Zoloft and Paxil (SSRIs) are currently FDA approved for PTSD. Which seems a bit odd to me, why only two medications? I've been on every antidepressant and antipsychotic imaginable, short of MAOIs and Thorazine. They NEVER helped. \\n\\nWhat HAS helped are high doses of benzos. That's the only thing so far I've found that actually helps, but I am really hoping I can get into the ketamine clinic and it helps. \\n\\nJust wondering if anyone has tried it, if it helped or not, and also if you're on meds what has actually helped you, if anything?   \n",

\\n\\nthe other thing is that she's sick a lot, she has a chronic illness that basically makes her really prone to long term sinus infections. it's something you can't see, so i never can tell if she's in pain or not. we moved south because of it when i was little, for the air quality. again, when i was little she was always sick and i didn't understand. she could never work or take us to the store, and i remember feeling confused, disappointed. \\n\\nnow it's more like, she's sick and everything's on pause. dad takes over dinner and everything, i have to drive my siblings to all the things and take on extra chores. it's confusing because she doesn't tell us that she's sick, that a sinus infection is coming on so i have no idea. and then the next day all of a sudden she's stuck in bed the whole day. \\n\\ni feel like the main thing as being the kid, i can't talk to her about my feelings or problems anymore. because 1. she's a therapist, she spends enough time hearing other's problems to care about mine 2. again, my problems are tiny compared to what she deal w on a daily basis. \\n\\ni guess right now where i am myself with my anxiety, ocd, i wish i had someone to talk to about it, the stuff w my mom too. but my friends have their own issues, and can't be the kind of support i need when it comes to this stuff. and like i don't think they'd understand the thing w my mom, i really don't know how to explain how it affects me, but it does. and whatever i tell my dad he tells my mom. i do see a therapist rn, but the sessions are more focused on my ocd. \\n\\ni guess the point of this was getting it out bc i cant sleep, but also i need some advice from anyone with similar experience?

             I’m 16 I have ptsd and anxiety with random triggers I’m so scared I’ll never find anyone and I’ll die alone it certainly doesn’t help that my ex hated me so much she made up rape allegations just to try to ruin my life I just feel so shitty constantly and even if I do find someone do they deserve the burden of my issues around them? God I hate my life and the people who did this too me.   \n",

A petite woman came out to talk to this tall guy, and he kept shutting her down - cutting her off, interrupting, raising his voice.\\n\\nI got triggered hard.  Started hyperventilating, heart started racing.  I tried the ask them guy to have a seat, because he was elderly and using a walker.  He refused, saying he was too mad to sit.  So then I just came right out and told him “listen, I know you’re mad - it’s palpable and I can feel it all the way over here- but could you do me a favor, and maybe sit down for a second?  You’re triggering my PTSD from working with the Army, and I would really appreciate it if your could bring yoir volume down a bit too please.”\\n\\nAfter that, the office lady came to escort him into an office - and asked if I would like to go into one when he loudly refused too.  She could tell I was shook.  I decided to go Outside instead.  Then I decided to LEAN INTO the panic attack (I was crying and shaking and it was hard to breathe).  I just started a YouTube channel on talking openly about mental\\nHealth issues and how I deal with my conditions as naturally as possible.  So I got my phone out and FILMED my Panic Attack - and how I was able to calm Myself down.  \\n\\nAnd it worked!  I got out my essential oils and worry stone and did deep breathing and practiced gratitude.  My panic attack went away, and I was able to go back into the office and not feel like a complete loser for losing my shit in there.  I even shared my Yoitube info and had a great chat with the office staff about mental health awareness.  It was a really awesome way to end what could have been a really horrible visit!\\n\\nJust wanted to share on here because I’m pretty friggin’ proud of myself right now!   \n",
